# MNIST_classification
This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits (0â€“9) using traditional machine learning algorithms on the MNIST dataset from Kaggle. Instead of deep learning, we compare the performance of several classical classifiers like XGBoost, SVM, Random Forest, and more using F1-score as the evaluation metric.
